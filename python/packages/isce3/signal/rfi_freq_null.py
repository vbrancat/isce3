        raw data to be processed, supports all numpy complex formats

        Number of blocks in the range dimension, default=1
        When num_rng_blks=1, all the range samples of the pulses within a 
        processing block are used to estimate detection mask.
    az_winsize: int, default=256
        The size (in number of pulses) of moving average Azimuth window 
        in which the averaged range spectrum is computed for narrowband detector.
    rng_winsize: int, default=100
        The size (in number of range bins) of moving average Range window 
        in which the total power in range spectrum is computed for wideband

        of the distribution. Defaults to 0.01.
    pvalue_threshold: float, default=0.005

        It is a threshold for the cumulative probability density function (CDF)

        (TVWB) masks. It represents an estimate of the probability of RFI likelihood
        in the input raw_data. A small cdf_threshold value results in a high threshold 
        for RFI detection.
    nb_detect: bool, default=True
        Controls whether narrowband RFI detection mask should be generated.
        If false, narrowband RFI detection mask are populated by zeros.

    Parameters
    ------------
    mask_tsnb: 2D array, int32
        Frequency domain TSNB hit mask based on p-value of the PDF of
        range frequency power spectra
    mask_tvwb: 2D array, int32
        Frequency domain TVWB hit mask based on p-value of the probability
        density function (PDF) of range frequency power spectra. Must be
        of the same shape as 'mask_tsnb'.
    cdf_threshold: float, default=0.1
        This is the  threshold for the cumulative probability density function (CDF) 
        of the input Time Stationary Narrowband (TSNB) and Time Varying Wideband 
        (TVWB) masks. It represents an estimate of the probability of RFI likelihood
        in the input raw_data. A small cdf_threshold value results in a high threshold 
        for RFI detection.

    Returns
    -------
    rfi_detect_mask: 2D array, bool, same dimension as input TSNB and TVWB masks
        Frequency domain binary RFI mask of combined TSNB and TVWB types of RFI.
