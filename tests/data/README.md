# Test Data

This README gives brief descriptions on the generation of various test data
found in this directory.

## Winnipeg

- The original product from which the test data are generated: winnip_31604_12061_004_120717_L090_CX_129_05.h5
  This is a UAVSAR NISAR simulated product. Check science/LSAR/identification/productVersion to get the product version
  As for NISAR data/ Simulated NISAR data have to be intended as zero-doppler

- All winnipeg-related "reference" products in this folder (e.g. warped_winnipeg.slc) have been generated using ISCE2 v2.3.
  The ISCE2 processing uses "winnip_31604_12061_004_120717_L090_CX_129_05.h5" as reference and secondary SLC to create the golden/reference dataset.

## Attitude

Attitude sample data in NISAR format (see JPL D-102264) was provided by the
G&C team (Dave Bates, et al) during NASA Internal Thread Test 04 (NITT-04)
activities in late 2020/early 2021. The hash of the original file delivered
by email is

```
$ md5sum NISAR_ANC_L_PR_FRP_20210114T023357_20200107T200000_20200109T040000.xml
2101bddf088d3b4e8e0e3051931f8284  NISAR_ANC_L_PR_FRP_20210114T023357_20200107T200000_20200109T040000.xml
```

To reduce the size of the test data, this file was trimmed to the first ten
records to produce `attitude.xml`.

## Orbit

Orbit sample data in NISAR format (see JPL D-102253) provided by Paul Ries
via email on 2020-07-06. It was generated from Jason2 data. The hash of the
original file is

```
$ md5sum -b smoothFinal.xml.gz
f415fc38e1feff0bb1453782be3d2b5f *smoothFinal.xml.gz
```

This file was uncompressed and trimmed to the first ten state vectors in
order to reduce the size of the `orbit.xml` file stored here.

# nisar_129_gcov_crop.h5

UAVSAR dataset NISARA_13905_19070_007_190930_L090_CX_129_02 from the AM/PM
campaing. The sample product was generated with parameters:
```
top_left:
   y_abs: 35.18
   x_abs: -83.46
bottom_right:
   y_abs: 35.13

```
## REE

Multi-channel L0B Raw data and HDF5 antenna pattern cuts (NISAR antenna format *v2*)
initially generated by Radar Echo Emulator tool, [*REE*](https://github.jpl.nasa.gov/SALSA-REE/REE_SRC),
and then post-processed and converted into L0B product via its python utility tool
[*ReeUtilPy*](https://github.jpl.nasa.gov/SALSA-REE/ReeUtilPy).
Note that these files may be stored in a separate location outside *isce3* repo.

- **REE_L0B_out17.h5**

  Simplest possible point target simulation: single target, uniform PRF, no
  noise, zero Doppler geometry.  Designed to test backproject and focus.py.
  REE input file preserved here (REE_L0B_out17.rdf).  Orbit and attitude data
  were dumped to NISAR XML format files in the `focus` subdirectory, which
  also contains a runconfig file for focus.py.  The target is located at
  longitude -54.579586258 deg, latitude 3.177088785 deg, height 0.0 m.  The
  file was generated using REE v14.8.6 and ReeUtilPy v2.11.1.

- **REE_RSLC_out17.h5**

  This is an RSLC product generated from the "out17" L0B data.  It only covers
  a small chip around the target and can be used for testing the point target
  analysis software.

- **REE_CR_INFO_out17.csv**

  NISAR-formatted CSV file for info of a single point target/ corner reflector (CR)
  of REE simulation with config/RDF file *REE_L0B_out17.rdf*.

- **REE_GSLC_out17_unflattened.h5**

  A NISAR GSLC product containing a single simulated point target for use in
  testing the GSLC point target analysis tool. The product was generated by
  geocoding the *REE_RSLC_out17.h5* dataset with a zero-height DEM with
  topographic flattening disabled using ISCE3 version v0.22.1.

- **REE_ANTPAT_CUTS_BEAM4.h5**

  Four-beam *NISAR* antenna pattern file. The original full *2-D* version of patterns
  come from datasets for case of *Case4g19c* generated by NISAR antenna team and stored
  on *JPL NISE* machine.
  This file contains the first four NISAR-like beams (nearest range ones).
  It containes both elevation and azimuth cuts of both polarizations *H* and *V*.
  The file is generated along with the L0B files "REE_L0B_CHANNEL4_EXTSCENE_PASS1...".
  That is the same antenna patterns used to generate the respective 4-channel L0B
  products.

- **REE_L0B_CHANNEL4_EXTSCENE_PASS1_LINE3000_CALIB.h5**

  Truncated version of first pass of repeat-pass four-channel *V*-polarized NISAR-like
  simulated *REE* L0B product over heterogenous urban-like simulated extended scene.
  The total number of truncated range lines is *3000*.
  The range bins has also been truncated from original datasets to get rid of far-range
  bins where there exist simply noise plus TX gap. The number of range bins is 1850.
  This dataset is suitable for demonstrating formation of three null patterns in elevation
  direction used in elevation pointing over heterogenous scene.
  The caltone has been already applied to individual RX channels via RxCal prior to its
  L0B file generation. Thus, RX channels are balanced out.
  Echo dataset has a shape of channel-by-rangeline-by-rangebin.
  This dataset is useful to test EL null-range product generation.

- **REE_L0B_CHANNEL4_EXTSCENE_PASS1_LINE3000_UNCALIB.h5**

  Similar to "REE_L0B_CHANNEL4_EXTSCENE_PASS1_LINE3000_CALIB.h5" with exception of no
  RxCal (caltone) has been applied. Thus, the RX channels are imbalance!
  This dataset is useful to test generation of EL null-range product with caltone flag.

## Calibration

- **rslc_calibration.yaml**

  An example YAML file input to focus.py that specifies parameters needed to
  produce calibrated RSLC products.

## Ampcor

- **data/ampcor/accuracy-testdata/ovs128-rho0.8/**

  This directory contains synthetic generated reference and secondary images
  for ampcor testing.

  The `golden/` subdirectory contains the expected ("golden") output against
  which both the CPU and GPU implementations are verified.

## Sub-Swath Mask

- **data/focus/sub_swaths.h5**

  This file is based on an ALOS test case.  A scene over Rosamond, CA, was
  downloaded and processed in the following ways:
  - An L0B file was generated with a fake TX gap in the near range using the
    `--simulate-gap` and `--gap-location` options to `alos_to_nisar_l0b.py`.
    The simulated gap is 5 microseconds longer than the chirp, like NISAR.
  - A second L0B file was generated with a fake TX gap in the far range.
  - Both files were split in half, with an azimuth gap in the middle using the
    `split_l0b.py` script.
  - The focus.py runconfig was set up for mixed-mode processing, using the first
    half L0B file with the near-range gap and the second half L0B file with the
    far-range gap.

  This emulates a possible NISAR case where mixed mode processing is active
  between two fixed-PRF modes that have a different PRF (which could happen
  when mixing DP and QP, for example) and there is also a recording gap between
  the two observations.
  
  A breakpoint was set in `focus.py` so that the arguments to
  `isce3.focus.get_focused_sub_swaths` could be manually dumped to this HDF5
  file, avoiding the need to add large L0B data files to the test suite.

  The "true" subswath mask was generated by also focusing the full, unmodified
  L0B file to an RSLC.  Both RSLCs were multilooked, and then the ratio of
  the two power images was computed.  In the valid data region, the ratio should
  be unity, so the result of `ratio > 0.999` was stored in the HDF5 file as the
  dataset named "mask".
